  bio: "<h1><b>Basal lamina in the base of intestinal furrow is an inductive site for the mucosal adaptive immune response in medaka fish</b></h1> <br> <br>
 Several organized lymphoid structures provide a niche that facilitates the initiation of adaptive immune response through stimulation of T-cells by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), in particular, dendritic cells (DCs). Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) are the most ancient secondary lymphoid tissues in vertebrates, although their organization and cellular composition vary across vertebrate groups. Peyer’s patches (PPs) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) are the main initiation sites of the GALTs in mammals. However these organized structures are missing in teleost fishes. It is not yet known where DCs migrate to interact with T-cells within the teleost gut. Hence, the organization of teleost GALT or an equivalent tissue is still not fully understood. We report here that young naïve T-cells after leaving the thymus migrate predominantly in the basal lamina in the base of the medaka intestinal furrow, where they traffic along the intestine and interact with antigen-loaded DCs both during homeostasis and in response to mucosal inflammation. Additionally we found that the epithelial cells in the medaka intestinal furrow produce Ccl25/Ccr9, a chemokine/chemokine receptor axis that is required for the recruitment of T-cells. Our findings suggest that the intestinal furrow provides an environment for T-lymphocyte and APC interaction during homeostasis and in response to inflammation. This indicate that the onset of adaptive immune response is spatially well-organized and the lack of lymphoid structures in teleost fish is compensated by recruitment of cellular components of the adaptive immune system in the basal lamina of intestinal furrow to perform their functions."

  bio: "To clarify both molecular/neural basis and brain information processing underlying social interactions in vertebrates, we have focused on Medaka fish and established novel behavior systems to assess social interactions (schooling behavior, individual recognition, group-escape and group-learning). Using these systems we are planning to identify internal factors (genes, neural networks, and brain regions) essential for vertebrate social interactions using transgenic medaka systems. On the other hand, to estimate behavior rules underlying social interactions, we developed a hypothesis-independent data mining, which could explain actual fish movement. Our eventual purpose is to how the internal factors (genes, neural networks, and brain regions) influences animal behaviors which can serve as the basis for the emergence of sociality.
Furthermore I have investigated the molecular/neural basis underlying invertebrate social behavior (honeybee) and compare neural/ social mechanisms between the vertebrate and invertebrate."

  bio: "I was born in Seoul, Korea, but grew up in New York City. I got my bachelor’s degree from Harvard and my Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley at the laboratory of Prof. Robert Tjian, before moving to Freiburg, Germany, for my postdoc at the laboratory of Prof. Wolfgang Driever. In Freiburg, I started working with zebrafish and have been continuing to work with zebrafish ever since. After my postdoc, I was a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg before moving to Mainz as a professor. I am fascinated by how stress hormones alter our behavior and the brain and would like to understand how stress resilience can be developed and fostered.<br> https://www.ryulab.org/ "

  bio: "		We have previously shown 4,100 K or “cool white” fluorescent light (FL) exposure induces cellular stress, inflammation and immune responses in the skin of several varied biomedical fish models including; platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), medaka, (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio)1.  
	Here we present RNA-seq results that establish similar patterns of modulated gene expression within two internal organs, brain and liver, of zebrafish and medaka exposed to 35 kJ/m2 FL.  In addition, FL light induced modulated gene expression within skin, brain and liver of both fish models is compared to similarly FL exposed hairless mice (Mus musculus). 
	In zebrafish and medaka, each of the three organs tested showed up-modulation of unique gene sets that are expected to activate the Acute Phase Response (APR) signaling pathway, leading to increased inflammation and innate immune response. Our pathway and gene clustering analyses suggest this response is due to increased cellular oxidative stress that promotes induction of the primary up-stream regulator, tumor necrosis factor (TNF).  Exposure of hairless mice to FL also serves to induce both inflammation and an immune response that mimics that observed in the fish models for both skin and brain. However, the FL induced genetic response in liver, although consistent and up-modulated in medaka and zebrafish, exhibits a suppressed response in mouse liver, but in the same pathways. 
	Overall, the sharing of genetic responses to light among divergent diurnal fishes, and a nocturnal mammal, suggests the genetic response to light is likely hard-wired deep within the vertebrate genome, and may extend through the vertebrate classes, perhaps even to humans.
