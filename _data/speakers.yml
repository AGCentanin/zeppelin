  bio: "I am currently working as senior post-doc at Heidelberg University. My main current focus of research is the study of the intestinal stem cell development.
After completing my PhD in Biology-Genetics, I joined the Max-Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics. My work focused on understanding the evolution and development of the thymus, a specialized primary lymphoid organ necessary for T-lymphocyte development, we identified a presumptive thymus equivalent tissue in the lamprey (Bajoghli, Aghaallaei, et al.,
Nature 2011). I also characterized the dendritic cells in fish for first time (Aghaallaei et al., PNAS, 2010). Now as an independent postdoc, I study the development of intestinal stem cells
in teleost gut. During this time, I realized that the combination of optical transparency
of fish gut and advanced tools of molecular biology provides a unique opportunity to
understand basic mechanisms that underlie immune response to tumor formation."

  title: "Prof."
  bio: "I was born in Seoul, Korea, but grew up in New York City. I got my bachelor’s degree from Harvard and my Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley at the laboratory of Prof. Robert Tjian, before moving to Freiburg, Germany, for my postdoc at the laboratory of Prof. Wolfgang Driever. In Freiburg, I started working with zebrafish and have been continuing to work with zebrafish ever since. After my postdoc, I was a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg before moving to Mainz as a professor. I am fascinated by how stress hormones alter our behavior and the brain and would like to understand how stress resilience can be developed and fostered.<br> https://www.ryulab.org/ "
