  bio: "<b>Basal lamina in the base of intestinal furrow is an inductive site for the mucosal adaptive immune response in medaka fish</b><br> <br>
 Several organized lymphoid structures provide a niche that facilitates the initiation of adaptive immune response through stimulation of T-cells by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), in particular, dendritic cells (DCs). Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) are the most ancient secondary lymphoid tissues in vertebrates, although their organization and cellular composition vary across vertebrate groups. Peyer’s patches (PPs) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) are the main initiation sites of the GALTs in mammals. However these organized structures are missing in teleost fishes. It is not yet known where DCs migrate to interact with T-cells within the teleost gut. Hence, the organization of teleost GALT or an equivalent tissue is still not fully understood. We report here that young naïve T-cells after leaving the thymus migrate predominantly in the basal lamina in the base of the medaka intestinal furrow, where they traffic along the intestine and interact with antigen-loaded DCs both during homeostasis and in response to mucosal inflammation. Additionally we found that the epithelial cells in the medaka intestinal furrow produce Ccl25/Ccr9, a chemokine/chemokine receptor axis that is required for the recruitment of T-cells. Our findings suggest that the intestinal furrow provides an environment for T-lymphocyte and APC interaction during homeostasis and in response to inflammation. This indicate that the onset of adaptive immune response is spatially well-organized and the lack of lymphoid structures in teleost fish is compensated by recruitment of cellular components of the adaptive immune system in the basal lamina of intestinal furrow to perform their functions."

  bio: "<b>Long search for the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; in the evolution of adaptive immune system: Identification of lymph node equivalent structures in medaka fish</b><br><br>In the past two decades, we have witnessed a renaissance in the study of the evolution of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. In particular, these studies have expanded our knowledge of the evolution of thymopoietic tissues, where T-lymphocytes develop. Furthermore, dendritic cells (DCs), which primarily serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems were identified in teleost fishes. Overall, these studies demonstrate that the cellular components of the adaptive immune system are evolutionarily conserved between vertebrates. However, secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), which spatially organising the interaction between lymphocytes and antigen-loaded DCs, are not well conserved across vertebrate groups. For example, lower vertebrates lack lymph node, a vital SLO in mammals. The great mystery is therefore where the adaptive immune response takes place in lower vertebrates. To address this fundamental question, we used medaka fish as a model system. In a comprehensive study, we discovered specific sites, where T-lymphocytes and DCs traffic and interact akin to mammalian lymph nodes. We found that these sites are distributed throughout the body facilitating a rapid adaptive immune response to local infections. Overall, our work provides a new evolutionary framework of the adaptive immune response in teleost fishes. "

  bio: "<b>Germ Cells - More than Gametogenesis</b><br><br>Germ cells are the only cells indispensible for producing the next generation. But it is generally recognized that germ cells are passive cells that can develop into only gametes. Actually the gametogenesis is strictly regulated by the surrounded somatic cells. However, our studies have begun to reveal the positive ability that germ cells possess. The germ cells do not only have intrinsic mechanism that determines their fate cell-autonomously, but also have the ability to change their environment. Our recent results indicate that germ cells have an intrinsic power to feminize the gonad and body, which can be against a power of masculinization by male sex determination gene, dmrt1bY. Analysis of controlling the germ cell number also suggests that regulation of germline stem cells is related to the size of gonad. I would like to summarize the potential ability of germ cells that were found during the course of our studies."

  bio: "<b>Analysis of YAP/TAZ-dependent transcriptional response during early morphogenesis in teleost embryos.</b><br><br>The Hippo signaling pathway is a genetic regulatory cascade that controls tissue homeostasis and organ size by coordinating the expression of proliferation, differentiation and apoptotic genes during development. The main constituents of this pathway are two effector proteins: YAP and its paralog TAZ (WWTR1). When YAP or TAZ are active, they get translocated into the cell nucleus and regulate the expression of their target genes interacting physically with TEAD, among other transcription factors. Here we show that Yap family’s paralogs composition is variable among vertebrates. Whereas many of the vertebrate branches maintained functional copies of both Yap and Taz (such as in tetrapods, spotted gar or zebrafish), Taz is not present in Acanthomorpha, the largest group of teleost fishes (e.g. cod, tilapia, platyfish, stickleback, or medakafish). In contrast, a second copy of Yap1, here referred as yap1b, appears conserved in their genomes. This closer paralog encodes for a protein with a divergent c-terminal transactivation domain. Interestingly, comparative analysis of zebrafish and medaka mutants shows that the mutation of yap1 in medaka (generated by CRISPR-Cas) results in a strong morphogenetic phenotype early during development, which is similar to the simultaneous mutation of yap1 and taz in zebrafish. We use iDamIDseq to identify the potential targets of these transcriptional regulators during gastrulation in medaka embryos. Our results, reinforced after carrying out a transcriptomic approach, indicate that the binding profile of yap1b is limited to a subset of the yap1 TEAD-dependent binding sites. Furthermore, the abundance of genes involved in cell migration in both datasets as well as the evidence from ISH and functional assays suggest the potential role of YAP as a regulatory driver of morphogenesis at early developmental stages."
