  bio: "I am currently working as senior post-doc at Heidelberg University. My main current focus of research is the study of the intestinal stem cell development.
After completing my PhD in Biology-Genetics, I joined the Max-Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics. My work focused on understanding the evolution and development of the thymus, a specialized primary lymphoid organ necessary for T-lymphocyte development, we identified a presumptive thymus equivalent tissue in the lamprey (Bajoghli, Aghaallaei, et al.,
Nature 2011). I also characterized the dendritic cells in fish for first time (Aghaallaei et al., PNAS, 2010). Now as an independent postdoc, I study the development of intestinal stem cells
in teleost gut. During this time, I realized that the combination of optical transparency
of fish gut and advanced tools of molecular biology provides a unique opportunity to
understand basic mechanisms that underlie immune response to tumor formation."

  bio: "To clarify both molecular/neural basis and brain information processing underlying social interactions in vertebrates, we have focused on Medaka fish and established novel behavior systems to assess social interactions (schooling behavior, individual recognition, group-escape and group-learning). Using these systems we are planning to identify internal factors (genes, neural networks, and brain regions) essential for vertebrate social interactions using transgenic medaka systems. On the other hand, to estimate behavior rules underlying social interactions, we developed a hypothesis-independent data mining, which could explain actual fish movement. Our eventual purpose is to how the internal factors (genes, neural networks, and brain regions) influences animal behaviors which can serve as the basis for the emergence of sociality.
Furthermore I have investigated the molecular/neural basis underlying invertebrate social behavior (honeybee) and compare neural/ social mechanisms between the vertebrate and invertebrate."

  bio: "I was born in Seoul, Korea, but grew up in New York City. I got my bachelor’s degree from Harvard and my Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley at the laboratory of Prof. Robert Tjian, before moving to Freiburg, Germany, for my postdoc at the laboratory of Prof. Wolfgang Driever. In Freiburg, I started working with zebrafish and have been continuing to work with zebrafish ever since. After my postdoc, I was a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg before moving to Mainz as a professor. I am fascinated by how stress hormones alter our behavior and the brain and would like to understand how stress resilience can be developed and fostered.<br> https://www.ryulab.org/ "

  bio: "		We have previously shown 4,100 K or “cool white” fluorescent light (FL) exposure induces cellular stress, inflammation and immune responses in the skin of several varied biomedical fish models including; platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), medaka, (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio)1.  
	Here we present RNA-seq results that establish similar patterns of modulated gene expression within two internal organs, brain and liver, of zebrafish and medaka exposed to 35 kJ/m2 FL.  In addition, FL light induced modulated gene expression within skin, brain and liver of both fish models is compared to similarly FL exposed hairless mice (Mus musculus). 
	In zebrafish and medaka, each of the three organs tested showed up-modulation of unique gene sets that are expected to activate the Acute Phase Response (APR) signaling pathway, leading to increased inflammation and innate immune response. Our pathway and gene clustering analyses suggest this response is due to increased cellular oxidative stress that promotes induction of the primary up-stream regulator, tumor necrosis factor (TNF).  Exposure of hairless mice to FL also serves to induce both inflammation and an immune response that mimics that observed in the fish models for both skin and brain. However, the FL induced genetic response in liver, although consistent and up-modulated in medaka and zebrafish, exhibits a suppressed response in mouse liver, but in the same pathways. 
	Overall, the sharing of genetic responses to light among divergent diurnal fishes, and a nocturnal mammal, suggests the genetic response to light is likely hard-wired deep within the vertebrate genome, and may extend through the vertebrate classes, perhaps even to humans.
